## Dev Summary
  Rocks fall is a page where users can create lobbies and make characters for D&D. The site will also double as a sort of wiki where users
can search for individual rules information.
  
  App will be a MERN Stack. The app also utilizes Socket.io for multiplayer lobbies and messaging, and redux primarily to help with authentication and session tracking
